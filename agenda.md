                    *   “Re-negotiation” 
    *   How can relative understanding of **actual privacy** be incorporated into consent actions? (relative vs. objective framing) 
        *   Example: does this grow or shrink my privacy footprint, and what does that mean for me? 
    *   How can sharing/consenting actions vary across the spectrum depending on who you are sharing with

        *   What is working well?
            *   Don’t overwhelm with questions/ filling out info at the beginning … instead start taking actions 
            *   Can just use it without having to learn it! (self-explanatory) 
            *   SSO elephant in room! 
                *   Rapidly becoming the norm to “Sign in with (Google/Facebook/etc.)” = “Math of Convenience” 
            *   When install app, verify secondary info (phone, email, DL, etc.)
                *   Treating onboarding as opportunity to create value 
            *   In-app integrations to other applications “magic” 
            *   No prior knowledge required
                *   Make as simple as possible  **COME BACK HERE**
            *   For the privacy nerds :) 
                *   Email receipt of actions in your account
                    *   Example: Github sends “freak out if this isn’t you” email
                *   2FA security factors, pros and cons  
                *   EU law allows to access information from a third party system, but have to put in bank sign in details 
        *   **Where are the common pain points? **
            *   Need to have minimum technical understanding to get through
                *   Test: “Can I give it to a person with less technical understanding and will they be successful?” 
            *   System impersonation 
            *   Single use codes, how make sure data is synced across devices and secured? Delegate to third party system and accept risks.
            *   Only option is to use single sign on instead of disconnected account (+1) 
            *   Different preferences for security vs. usability
            *   SSO provides ease of not having to manage multiple passwordsBalancing security vs. number of clicks 
            *   Examples of showing security in the UI
                *   Visible security twitter check vs. actual verification
    *   What is different about onboarding when decentralized technology is involved? (DID/ VC/ etc. -- B2C or B2B) 
    *   Similarities / differences to existing flows
        *   Conceptual difference in approach, much more work up front 
        *   Onboarding a wallet
        *   Onboarding credentials
        *   Connecting to an existing identity 
    *   Example flow 1:
        *   Create wallet
        *   Create self-issued assertions (VCs)
            *   Ability to do things with those credentials right away 
        *   Jump… bringing in third party trusted credentials 
    *   Example flow 2 (more b2b + government)
        *   Start with basic education about SSI, start with government appreciation
            *   Understand what VCs and other countries are implementing
            *   (Translation of w3c to Thai language) 
        *   Provide wallets to businesses first 
    *   Example flow 3: (b2b working with issuers)
        *   Issuer wants to provide credential
        *   A business has to quickly get a wallet to receive the credential, and present it to others in the future 
    *   Example flow 4: 
        *   Go where users are to 
        *   start… start using locked-down enterprise grade application 
        *   Other examples of workflows: Torus and Fortmatic (now Magic)
        *   Starting with more managed experiences, then move towards more self-managed 
        *   Why would these enterprises let your data go?
            *   Apple example: we won’t farm your data… but we will capture you inside our systems 
            *   Privacy regulations (GDPA, CCPA, + Brazil) 
                *   What is less expensive? The fine, or the compliance implementation? 
    *   Example flow 5:
        *   Melbourne wallets paper, have for a regional target audience 
    *   Notes:
        *   How do you go from someone who doesn’t have a wallet to someone who does?
            *   Note: “their is a “competing project” launching next week claiming it has figured out on boarding to give everyone a decentralized ID in their centralized network [http://www.didalliance.org](http://www.didalliance.org)” 
        *   Kaliya proposed idea: “maybe the product managers could collaborate on a “common on-boarding flow” for people going from no wallet to having a wallet with a credential.” 
    *   New opportunities? (discuss sample flows) 
    *   New pain points? (relate back to above personas) 
    *   Questions raised, pros and cons of different approaches
*   Example 6: A wallet for Melbournian - a regional target audience:  \

*   Next meeting… lets go specifically into best practices around the following two workflows:
    *   Consumer-oriented flow
        *   Create Wallet → Create self-certified credential → Receive third party credential
    *   Business-oriented flow
        *   Issuer creates credential → Business goes to claim → Creates wallets → Receives Credential
    *   (Connect to CCG/ competition efforts) 

Other points:



*   How big is the delta between what experts understand as the risks and what end users understand

Product Group Invitation & Talking Points (Draft)



*   Current groups.io description: “An open discussion group hosted under DIF for Identity professionals to discuss and evolve decentralized Identity product-related work.” 
*   Updated description:
    *   The DIF Product community group is an open discussion space for anyone interested in connecting the dots between real-world needs and the technology discussed in other DIF groups. Recurring topics include user experience, design patterns, terminology, business value, and cross-company interoperability. 
    *   Group members can join monthly calls with the following format:
        *   **Ecosystem update **(10 min) - Keep tabs on DIF related standards progress, conferences, legal/regulatory, and helpful resources
        *   **Topic discussion** (20min) - Discuss a community driven topic that relates to the shared challenges of building and distributing decentralized identity products.
        *   **Product demos** (20-30 min)- Ranging from polished app demos to early ideation, group members can share a 5 minute demo and get detailed feedback from the group
    *   Members can also initiate asynchronous discussions in the groups.io chat to solicit feedback or organize around work items. 

**Potential Topic Ideas:**



*   How do we express <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cryptographic trust i</span>n a user experience? 
*   How do we drive decentralized identity adoption with current web infrastructure in a modular approach? 
*   How will digital identity wallets look in 5 years for individuals? for organizations?
